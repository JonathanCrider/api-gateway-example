# API Skill Assessment

Thank you for the opportunity to showcase my API development skills. Please reach out if you have any questions or have any trouble setting up the project. I've tried to be as thorough as possible, but I could certaily have missed something.

The SQL Test is also included in this project: [**SQL Test**](https://github.com/JonathanCrider/api-skill-assessment/blob/main/docs/SQLtest.md)

## Project setup

### Development Environment

To set up the development environment, you'll need to install the following tools:

1. **Node.js**  
   Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to execute JavaScript code server-side. You'll need it to run the server for this project.  
   - [Download and Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)  
   - [Node.js Documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)  

2. **NPM (Node Package Manager)**  
   NPM comes bundled with Node.js and is used to manage dependencies for your project. To verify if NPM is installed, run:  
   ```bash
   npm --version
   ```  
   - [NPM Documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/)  

3. **SQLite**  
   SQLite is a lightweight, serverless database engine used in this project.
   - [Download SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html)  
   - [SQLite Documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html)  

Make sure your environment variables are properly configured (e.g., using `.env` files).

```env
PORT=3001
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=
STRIPE_SECRET_API_KEY=
X_API_KEY=
```
